SocialGram App

To launch the React app, follow these steps:

    Navigate to the root folder of the project.
    Run the command npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
    Run the command npm run dev to start the development server.

Once the server is running, you can access the app in your web browser by navigating to localhost. From there, you can sign up and create a new user, or use the test user credentials I've been using: email - asd@stud.noroff.no, password - asdfasdfasdf.
